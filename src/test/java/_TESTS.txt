We utilize tests to make sure key components of the code can compile, and if there were to be any problems,
the debugger would be able to pinpoint what is the problem based on the tests that pass.
If all pass, that means there is a logic error, within the code, or an object in the code is not being initialzed correctly.
Otherwise, if a test DOES fail, make sure the object declarations are not leading to null pointers.
